      <description>This is a cooking App design inspired my mom who can always make wonders by using food ingredients left in the refrigerator. Food Ninja is also my first UI design practice encouraged by my teammates in the Infinite Studio.
 Introduction This App called “FoodNinja” which offers recipes for a healthy and quick meal which can be easily processed by novices. It is also dedicated to dealing with the food ingredients left in the refrigerator in an effective way which don’t need to be worried about, just like what a Ninja can do.</description>
